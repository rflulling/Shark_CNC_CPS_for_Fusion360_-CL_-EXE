# Shark_CNC_CPS_for_Fusion360_-CL_-EXE
This project encompases years of frustration watching coworkers wage a fight of their own making on a Shark CNC from Next Wave. Due availability issues of who a has a psot processor, they have had no choice but to use Vcarve for all of their needs.  This project aims to offer options through Fusion360, command line, and drag and drop EXE.
